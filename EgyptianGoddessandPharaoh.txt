Egyptian Goddess and Pharaoh

The Egyptian Goddess Blue, goddess of the sky, the stars and the celestial canopy, sits in her corner of the heavens, pondering how she can achieve more power.  Her thoughts turn to Johnses, Pharaoh of Egypt, wondering how she can use him and his minions to her benefit.  Johnses has a vast army and nearly limitless resources and power, and would be a worthy ally in her quest to take over the heavens and the earth.  He is also reportedly a man of epic virility, conquering women as he does empires.  All this lusting for power and control, and thoughts of Johnses legendary manhood stirs up a more primal lust.  She contemplates bringing in her servants to tend to her needs, but decides she can do a better job herself.

Goddess Blue goes to her bedroom, and climbs under the canopy of her bed, removing her layers of flowing robes as she does so.  Her fingers find her already moist core, and gently teases her heavenly womanhood.  She moans, imagining it is Johnses probing her divine flower with his tongue.  Blue takes her time, slowly building towards her eruption deliberately, first stimulating the outer lips, then her clit, then finally slipping a tantalizing finger inside.  Oh, the feeling is magical, she savors her touch, slowly sliding one finger in and out, and then two.  Wanting to more closely mimic Johnses size, she adds a 3rd finger, crying out with pleasure at the fullness and intensity of her strokes, imagining it is he, not her fingers, powerfully pounding away at her precious petals of love.  Finally she can take no more, and allows herself to climax, spraying her divine dew all over her fingers, her hands, and the fabrics on the bed.  She lays there for awhile, allowing the waves of pleasure to slowly subside, freeing her mind to once again focus on world domination.

It doesnâ€™t take long to formulate her plan, she will seduce Johnses with her radiant beauty and mesmerizing sexuality.  She then plot how to put his in motion, starting with invading Johnses dreams.
